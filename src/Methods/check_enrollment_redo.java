Enhance the CheckEnrollment class from the if Statements lesson by adding a method
named canEnroll to it. The method canEnroll has the following parameters:
monthDeadline: an int containing the month after which you cannot enroll in the
course.
dayDeadline: an int containing the day of month after which you cannot enroll in
the course.
numStudents: an int containing the number of students currently enrolled in the
Class.
The method canEnroll returns a boolean which is true if you can enroll in the class. The
conversion of month and day to a single integer should be performed inside canEnroll .
Call canEnroll for Java, European History, and Contemporary Art. Print whether or not you
can register for each class.
