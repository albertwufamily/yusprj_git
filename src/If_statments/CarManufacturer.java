Rewrite the  CarManufacturer  class of the Expressions lesson using conditional

the major car manufacturers. If it matches one of the selections, print a string
containing the name of the company matched. Otherwise, print a string that 
contains the name of your car’s manufacturer and indicates that it is not one of
the major companies.
